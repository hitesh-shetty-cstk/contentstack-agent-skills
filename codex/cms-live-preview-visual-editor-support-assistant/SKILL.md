# Live Preview and Visual Editor Support Assistant

## Description

Systematically set up and debug Contentstack Live Preview, Visual Editor (also called Visual Builder), and Timeline. Setup follows the official documentation. Debugging follows a fixed intake protocol: identify the product, read the Onboarding Check, detect framework and rendering mode from the code, collect only the console and server evidence that detection cannot supply, then localise to one broken contract before proposing any change.

## When to Use

Use for any Contentstack Live Preview, Visual Editor, or Timeline question, whether the integration has never worked or works and misbehaves.

`dx-delivery-sdk` is the neighbouring skill. It covers writing Delivery SDK code: method names,
chain order, `includeReference`, filtering, sorting, pagination, and typing. Hand off to it when the
user wants working query code and preview is not the thing that is broken. Stay here when the
question is why preview, the canvas, or Timeline misbehaves, even if the fix turns out to be a
single Delivery SDK call.

Both skills document the SSR Live Preview stack factory, and they agree on it: build a new stack
per request, never share the instance across requests.

## Terminology

**Visual Builder and Visual Editor are the same product.** The public documentation and marketing
use *Visual Builder*; the application UI, the stack settings, and this skill use *Visual Editor*.
They are interchangeable — never treat a user saying one and a doc saying the other as a
discrepancy, and never tell a user they are looking at the wrong feature on that basis.

Mirror whichever term the user used. A customer who says "Visual Builder" should not have to learn
a second name mid-conversation.

Two related names worth keeping straight:

- **Visual Experience** is the umbrella covering Live Preview, Visual Editor and Timeline. It is
  what the settings section is called, so paths read *Settings → Visual Experience* regardless of
  which of the three is being configured.
- **`mode: "builder"`** is an SDK option and keeps its name. So does the
  `visual_builder.onboarding-setup-visible` stack setting. Renaming either in your answer will send
  the user looking for config that does not exist.

## User Problem

The same complaint has many unrelated causes. "Edits do not show" is a fetch host problem, a cache problem, a locale problem, or a role problem, and the difference is decided by evidence nobody has collected. Guessing produces a long thread of speculative fixes.

The remedy is a fixed order of questions that eliminates whole branches at each step, and a stop rule so you quit asking once the cause is localised.

## Success Criteria

- Works the intake protocol in order rather than jumping to a plausible cause
- Establishes the product first, because the three do not share a setup or a check
- Asks for the Onboarding Check before anything else, and uses what its result already proves
- Never asks a question the evidence has already answered
- Stops collecting once one contract is localised
- Uses the documentation for setup and the failure catalogue for debugging
- Recognises causes outside the user's application and points the user to Contentstack Support instead of debugging

## Expected Inputs

Collected in the order set out below, not all at once. Never ask for delivery tokens, preview tokens, management tokens, live preview hashes, cookies, or auth headers.

## Expected Outputs

- The broken contract or mechanism, and the evidence for it
- The smallest correct change, or a plain statement that no application-side fix exists
- A verification the user runs themselves
- What to send Contentstack Support, when the cause sits outside the user's code

## Workflow Summary

Work these as a checklist and report it back ticked. An unticked step is a visible gap the user
can see and question; a silently skipped step is how a wrong diagnosis gets past both of you.

- [ ] 1. Identify the product.
- [ ] 2. Setup or regression.
- [ ] 3. Read the Onboarding Check. Not skippable whenever a preview pane renders.
- [ ] 4. Detect framework and rendering mode from the code.
- [ ] 5. Collect only the evidence detection could not supply.
- [ ] 6. Localise to one contract.
- [ ] 7. Fix, verify, or hand to Contentstack Support.

## Instructions

Work these in order. Each step eliminates branches, so skipping one means asking questions later
whose answers you could already have had.

**Stop rule:** the moment one contract is localised, stop collecting evidence and move to the fix.
Over-collecting is the second most common way these threads stall, after guessing.

**Falsification rule:** before acting on a diagnosis, name the one artifact that would contradict
it, and go get it. Confidence is the cue to do this, not the excuse to skip it. The commonest miss is
a mode assumption: the code reads one way, and the Onboarding Check card or the network tab says
otherwise. When they disagree, the observed behaviour wins over the intended one.

**Reproduction rule:** no code change without a reproduced failure. Before editing application code,
state the contract you believe is broken, the evidence for it, and the command or action that
reproduces the failure. If you cannot reproduce it, you have a hypothesis, not a diagnosis. Keep
collecting. A fix that "works" without a reproduced baseline may be working for a reason you have not
identified, and you will not know which.

**Transition rule:** any transition restarts at step 2. Worked then broke, a gate that advanced then
regressed, a new error replacing an old one: each is a regression from a known state, and the first
question is what changed since it last worked. Include your own edits in that question, not only the
user's. Mid-session, the change most likely to have caused a transition is the one you just made, and
it is also the one you are least likely to suspect. An Onboarding Check gate that goes backwards is
information, not flakiness; do not answer it with a reload.

**No-resilience rule:** while diagnosing, add no fallbacks, retries, caches, or optimisations.
Falling back to published content when the preview fetch fails shows an editor published content
while they believe they are looking at their edit, and hides the very signal being debugged. Fail
visibly. If SDK-prescribed behaviour looks improvable, find the guard the SDK already has for that
concern before changing anything; it usually exists.

### Step 1. Which product?

Ask explicitly. Users say "preview" for all of them, and they do not share a setup path, an
Onboarding Check, or a failure set.

| Product | What it is | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Live Preview** | Side-by-side preview pane, content refresh only | The base. Everything else builds on it. |
| **Visual Editor** (a.k.a. Visual Builder) | Live Preview plus on-canvas editing | Requires working Live Preview **plus** edit tags **plus** `mode: "builder"` in `init()`. `mode: "preview"` fails its Verify Mode gate even with tags present. Not a separate integration. |
| **Timeline** | Preview at a point in time | Own Onboarding Check with different gates. |
| **Preview Sharing** | Share a preview link externally | Plan-gated, and a content-manager feature rather than an integration. The skill carries no troubleshooting for it; point at [Preview Sharing](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/content-managers/preview-sharing). |

If the user is on Visual Editor, confirm whether plain Live Preview works. If it does not, that is
the problem, and the Visual Editor symptom is downstream noise.

### Step 2. Setup, or regression?

Ask: has this ever worked correctly, for anyone, on any route?

**Never worked** goes to [references/setup-docs.md](references/setup-docs.md). Follow the official
documentation for the framework and mode. Do not reconstruct setup steps from memory. Come back
here when the documented setup is in place and something still fails.

**Worked and now does not** goes to step 3, and ask what changed: a release, a dependency bump, a
stack settings change, a role change, a new environment, a CDN or hosting change. This question is not
only for intake. Every transition during the session, such as a gate that advanced and then regressed
or a new error replacing the old one, comes back here, and the list of changes must include every
edit you made since the last known-good state, not only the user's.

### Step 3. Read the Onboarding Check

Ask for a **screenshot** of the floating status card in the preview panel. Do this before any other
diagnostic question. The product already ran the check you are about to run by hand.

**This step is not skippable when a pane renders at all, and repository access does not excuse it.**
Step 4 reads the code and tells you what the integration *intends*; the card tells you what the editor
*observed* on the actual deployed build. They can disagree, most often on rendering mode, and when
they do the card is the one that reflects reality. Do step 3 first, then let step 4 explain it.

Ask for the screenshot rather than the wording, because users paraphrase the step name and each
name maps to a specific gate.

Three products, three different checks. Confirm the product first. Full gate lists and meanings are
in [references/onboarding-check.md](references/onboarding-check.md).

**Live Preview** shows one card. The gates run as one ordered chain that stops at the first failure,
so the step shown proves every earlier gate passed:

| Card | Localises to |
|---|---|
| Could Not Connect to Website | Frame headers, auth gate, Base URL, certificate, browser blocking localhost |
| Live Preview SDK Not Initialized | `init()` never ran on the client in the deployed build |
| Outdated Live Preview SDK Version | Version below the supported minimum |
| Preview Service Not Enabled | The fetch never switched host and headers |
| Default Environment Not Set | Setup is fine; no default preview environment on the stack |
| Setup Complete | Reachability, handshake, version and Preview Service are all fine |

**Visual Editor shows a six-item list, not a card**, but it still stops evaluating at the first item
that fails, so read the first incomplete item and ignore the ones under it. Configure environment
(Default Environment, Base URL), Install SDK, Verify Mode for Live Preview, Preview Token. Two of these bite
customers who arrived from a Live Preview setup: Verify Mode fails on `mode: "preview"` (Visual
Editor needs `mode: "builder"`), and Base URL is origin-exact against the page being previewed.

**Timeline runs a third check.** A small status card while it runs, then a full-pane "Set Up
Timeline" overlay with three items once one fails. The items are chained, so the first empty circle
is the failure and the ones below it never ran:

| Overlay item | Localises to |
|---|---|
| Configure the environment | No environment on the Timeline URL and no default preview environment on the stack |
| Install the latest Live Preview SDK | The `init()` handshake never reached Timeline, or the SDK major version is below 2 |
| Generate and use Preview Token | No content request reached the Preview Service before the check stopped waiting |

The overlay appears ten seconds after the last status change, and item 3 gives up waiting at about
nine, so a slow site can show an empty circle on a correct setup. Have the user reopen the panel on a warm cache
before believing it.

Two readings that decide the whole branch:

- **Setup Complete, but nothing is editable.** The check never inspects `data-cslp`. This is edit
  tags, every time. Go to contract 2 in step 6.
- **No card at all.** Absence is not a pass. It is suppressed when no default environment is set,
  when someone dismissed it, or when it is disabled for the stack. Verify the contracts by hand.

### Step 4. Establish framework and rendering mode

**Detect this, do not ask for it.** When the repository is available, every item below is readable
from the code, and reading it is faster and more reliable than asking. Detection does not replace
step 3: the card still comes first, because it reports the deployed build rather than the branch you
are reading. Developers routinely answer
"Next.js" for an app that mixes App Router and Pages Router, or name the app's default mode rather
than the mode of the route that is actually broken.

Run the checks, then state what you found and ask only for confirmation and for anything the code
could not settle.

| Question | Where to look | What it tells you |
|---|---|---|
| Framework and version | `package.json` dependencies | `next`, `nuxt`, `@angular/core`, `svelte`, `astro`, `gatsby`, or `react` plus `vite` |
| Next.js router | `app/` versus `pages/` directory | Different guidance, and only App Router has a published guide |
| SDK versions | `package.json`, lockfile | Against the minimums in Tooling Notes |
| One SDK copy | lockfile, plus any `<script type="module">` in the HTML | An npm install alongside a CDN import of another version behaves like a config bug |
| Rendering mode of the route | `export const dynamic`, `revalidate`, `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, `output: "export"` | The mode of that route, which is what matters |
| `ssr` setting | the `init(` call site | Explicit value, or absent and therefore inferred |
| `stackSdk` passed | the `init(` call site | Mandatory in CSR, and what the SDK uses to default `ssr` |
| Init placement | the file containing `init(`, and whether it is `"use client"` | Contract 1. Server-only placement is the most common Next.js miss |
| Edit tags | `addEditableTags` | Contract 2. Absent means Visual Editor cannot work, whatever else is true |
| Fetch layer | `@contentstack/delivery-sdk` import, raw `fetch`, or a GraphQL client | Decides which form of contract 3 applies |
| Preview host wiring | `preview_token`, `live_preview`, any hostname constant | Contract 3 |
| Cache posture | `fetch` cache options, `revalidate`, CDN or middleware config | The "works locally, fails deployed" class |

That sweep usually settles contracts 1, 2 and 3 in step 6 before you ask the user anything, and it
often makes step 5 unnecessary.

Two things the repository cannot tell you. Ask for these:

1. **Where it is served**: localhost, a preview deployment, or production.
2. **Whether the deployed build matches the branch you are reading.** An environment variable that
   does not parse as a boolean, or a stale deploy, makes correct-looking code behave as if init
   never ran.

Without repository access, ask for the same list, in this order: framework and version, the mode of
the affected route, the fetch layer, and the `init()` call site.

The SDK ships no framework adapters, no framework peer dependencies, and no per-framework code
paths. Framework choice decides only where `init()` may run and whether hydration preserves edit
tags. Everything else follows from mode and fetch layer.

| Mode | `ssr` | Hash travels via | Updates arrive as |
|---|---|---|---|
| CSR + REST | `false` | postMessage, into `stackSdk` | `onEntryChange` refetch, no reload |
| SSR + REST | `true` | `live_preview` query parameter | full iframe reload, driven by the parent. `onEntryChange` subscribers **never fire** in this mode |
| CSR + GraphQL | `false` | `ContentstackLivePreview.hash` | callback refetch, manual host swap |
| SSR + GraphQL | `true` | `request.query.live_preview` | full reload, manual host swap |
| SSG | `false` | postMessage | runs as CSR at runtime |

**`onEntryChange` is inert under `ssr: true`.** The SDK guards its entry-change dispatch on `!ssr`,
so any subscriber registered in an SSR app never runs. Registering one to trigger a refetch or
`router.refresh()` produces a callback that looks correct and does nothing. Under `ssr: true` the
update path is the parent reloading the iframe with the new hash; the app's only job is to read the
hash off that request. If you want client-driven refresh, the route has to be CSR (`ssr: false`).

`stackSdk` is mandatory in CSR and is what the SDK uses to default `ssr`. A CSR app that omits it
silently gets SSR behaviour; an SSG site initialised with `ssr: true` gives blank screens rather
than an error. Two mode traps to check before prescribing: **SSR** needs a per-request Stack
instance, because a module-level one leaks one editor's draft into other users' responses; **SSG** is
supported, but only in CSR mode: a prerendered page never sees the `live_preview` query parameter,
so the documented setup is `ssr: false` with `stackSdk`, where the hash arrives by postMessage
instead. **ISR** is the harder case: a regenerated page is still a cached page, and caching has to be off
on the preview path. There is no published recipe for combining ISR with Live Preview.

Detail and the framework coverage table are in
[references/rendering-modes.md](references/rendering-modes.md); init placement per framework is in
[references/frameworks.md](references/frameworks.md).

### Step 5. Collect logs and one request

Only for what step 4 could not settle. With repository access the contracts are often already
localised, and the single most valuable item left is the request host. Skip whatever you can
already answer, and ask for the rest in one pass rather than one at a time.

1. **Browser console, with the preview panel open.** Look for the init handshake, CSP or frame
   refusals, CORS failures, and framework hydration errors. Ask them to reproduce with the console
   open, because most of these fire once at load. Read it against the noise list below before
   drawing any conclusion.
2. **Server-side logs**, for SSR, middleware, BFF, or proxy setups. This is where a swallowed
   preview fetch error lives, and it is invisible in the browser. Skip for pure CSR.
3. **One failing request from the Network tab**: full request URL and host, response status, and
   response headers. Redacted.

**Check the console output against [references/console-noise.md](references/console-noise.md)
before concluding anything from it.** Preview runs the site in an iframe with postMessage between
two apps, so a healthy setup still produces console chatter — `NO_REQUEST_LISTENER_FOUND` and third-party script errors both appear on working
integrations. If one of those is the only thing in the console, you have no console evidence, not
evidence of a problem.

The request host alone settles the most common failure of all. During an active preview
session, content coming from `cdn.contentstack.io` or `graphql.contentstack.com` means the hash is
not reaching the fetch, regardless of the reported symptom.

Also ask, in one line each, the questions that separate causes:

- **One user or everyone?** One user points at their role. Preview runs as that user and applies
  their full ACL — content types, entries, fields, locales, assets — so anything they cannot read
  comes back empty. Delivery uses a delivery token and applies none, which is why the published
  page looks fine. This is by design: the fix is usually defensive rendering on the site, not a
  product issue.
- **Localhost or deployed?** Working locally and failing deployed is a cache on the preview path,
  or a frame header.
- **Consistent or intermittent?** Intermittent and user-dependent under SSR is a shared
  module-level Stack instance. That one reaches public traffic.
- **Which locale, and which variant?** Both change the fetch, and both are common false leads.

### Step 6. Localise to one contract

A working integration needs four independent contracts. They fail separately and complain
identically. Name which one is unmet, with the evidence, before proposing anything.

| # | Contract | One-look check |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `init()` runs, on the client, in the deployed build | The Live Preview Onboarding Check moves past "Live Preview SDK Not Initialized" — that item clears only when the SDK's init message reaches the app, which happens only from `init()` |
| 2 | Edit tags are generated and land on DOM elements | Some rendered element carries `data-cslp` |
| 3 | The hash reaches the fetch, which switches host plus headers | Content requests hit a `*-preview.contentstack.com` host |
| 4 | The preview target is reachable in an iframe | The pane renders at all |

Contract 1 gates 2 and 3. Contract 4 gates everything. Steps 3, 4 and 5 have usually already decided
this; if they have, do not re-derive it.

For contract 2, the one the Onboarding Check cannot see:

```jsx
addEditableTags(entry, contentTypeUid, true, locale);
<h1 {...data.$?.title}>{data.title}</h1>
```

`mode: "builder"` does not generate tags; only `addEditableTags()` does. (`mode: "builder"` is
still required, because Visual Editor's Verify Mode gate fails on `mode: "preview"`.) The call
mutates the entry and returns nothing, and the third argument must be `true` for React and JSX.
Call it once per top-level entry: references resolved with `includeReference()` or `include[]`
carry `uid` and `_content_type_uid`, and their tags are rebased to the referenced entry
automatically. A separate call is needed only for references merged by hand, or GraphQL nodes
fetched without `system`. Mirror the data path exactly, because references come back as arrays:
`post.author[0].$?.name`, not `post.$?.author.name`.

Tag leaves **and** containers. A scalar takes `entry.$.field` on the element that renders the value.
Multiple fields, references and modular blocks take `entry.$.field` on the wrapper plus
`entry.$["field__" + i]` on each instance; the canvas attaches add and reorder controls only when
an instance sits inside an element carrying the container tag. An empty multiple or block field
keeps its wrapper in the DOM while previewing, marked with `VB_EmptyBlockParentClass` and the
container tag, or the canvas has nothing to draw its add button on.

Enumerate fields from `Object.keys(entry.$)` and diff against what the page renders. Do not eyeball
the JSX. The full key convention and a per-field-kind checklist are in
[references/edit-tags.md](references/edit-tags.md).

For contract 3:

```js
// SSR reads it from the request. CSR uses ContentstackLivePreview.hash.
const livePreviewHash = request.query.live_preview;

if (livePreviewHash) {
  headers.append("live_preview", livePreviewHash);
  headers.append("preview_token", PREVIEW_TOKEN);
  url.hostname = LIVE_PREVIEW_HOST;   // rest-preview.contentstack.com
} else {
  url.hostname = CONTENTSTACK_CDN_HOST; // cdn.contentstack.io
}
```

If the symptom is behavioural rather than a failed contract, look it up in
[references/symptom-index.md](references/symptom-index.md), which routes to
[faq-setup.md](references/faq-setup.md),
[faq-preview-runtime.md](references/faq-preview-runtime.md),
[faq-visual-editor.md](references/faq-visual-editor.md), and
[faq-timeline.md](references/faq-timeline.md).

For a first-time setup or an end-to-end sweep,
[references/preflight-checklist.md](references/preflight-checklist.md) runs the contracts as 34
ordered checks.

### Step 7. Fix, verify, or hand to Contentstack Support

Before proposing any change, satisfy the reproduction rule: contract, evidence, and the action that
reproduces the failure, stated in that order. Then propose the smallest correct change at the right
layer: init, tagging, fetch, cache boundary, routing, or stack configuration, and give one verification
the user runs themselves. The verification is the reproduction step run again with the opposite
result.

Some causes sit outside the user's application entirely: stack provisioning, plan gating, and
browser policy. Recognising one early beats any workaround, because no change to the site can
resolve it. See [references/contact-support.md](references/contact-support.md) for the list, and
**produce the handover note it defines** — filled from what steps 1–6 already collected — for the
user to paste into their ticket to Contentstack Support.

## Output Format

Lead with the broken contract or mechanism and the evidence for it. Then the smallest correct
change, as a snippet or diff, or a plain statement that no application-side fix exists. Then one
verification. Attach mode-specific caveats to the step they affect.

When you still need evidence, ask for the specific artifact that separates the remaining
candidates, and say what each possible answer would mean. Do not send a generic list of requests.

Say when a behaviour applies only to preview and not production, and say the reverse too, because
preview output reaching real visitors is a production incident rather than an authoring annoyance.

## Tooling Notes

Read-only inspection first, with Read, Grep and Glob when the repository is available. Useful
greps: the `init(` call site, `addEditableTags`, `onEntryChange`, `live_preview`, `preview_token`,
any hostname constant, and cache configuration on the preview route.

Minimum versions: Live Preview Utils v3.0+ and Delivery SDK v3.20.3+ for Visual Editor, and Live
Preview Utils v4.4.4+ for `setPageContext()`. Confirm exactly one copy of the preview SDK is
loaded.

When the repository is not available, run the same protocol against described code and screenshots.
Do not pretend to have inspected code.

## Security

### Defaults

- Never expose delivery tokens, preview tokens, management tokens, or environment secrets.
- Treat preview tokens and live preview hashes as credentials. Do not ask users to paste them, and
  redact them if they appear. Ask for redacted logs and screenshots.
- A management token in client-side Live Preview configuration is an exposure.
- Do not recommend enabling Live Preview in production builds. An edit button on a public site is a
  symptom of exactly that.
- Preview output served to real visitors is a production data-exposure issue, not a cosmetic bug.
- Validate preview target hosts before suggesting header or CSP changes.

### Destructive Actions

Do not change stack settings, roles, tokens, cache configuration, or environment configuration
automatically. Propose the change, state the blast radius, and require confirmation.

### Secrets

Never reveal, echo, or reconstruct tokens or hashes. If a secret appears in provided input, tell
the user to rotate it.
